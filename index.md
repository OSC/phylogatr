## About PhylogatR

PhylogatR brings together genetic data with georeferenced specimen records that are analysis-ready. Analysis of these data can be conducted on the Ohio Supercomputer using R scripts or R Shiny apps provided by the PhylogatR team. PhylogatR supports both professional biologists and educational modules intended for secondary or college classes.

**We are now accepting applications for PhylogatR beta-testers. Serving as a beta-tester will give you access to the full database for at least 6 months before it is released to the public, cool swag, and the opportunity to participate in an in-person workshop (once conferences are in-person again). If you are interested in becoming a beta-tester, please fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/109sF-e9WIdsSY57ZBx41ckMB9IK2AHW5_b5PjZJhTEg/edit).**

## Teacher Resources

We are currently developing educational modules for use in secondary and college level classes. Modules will support interactive analysis of PhylogatR data through R Shiny applications and include documentation for educators to facilitate classroom use and ensure specific learning objectives are met.  

You can access working drafts of these modules below.


| Module  | Purpose  | Link  |
| :----  | :-----  | :------ |
| Checking Your Data  | Check genetic and geographic data downloaded from PhylogatR through visualization of: i) aligned DNA sequences for all loci present for a particular species in the database and ii) geographic coordinates for all individuals within that species. | [Checking Your Data](assets/modules/Checking_Your_Data.html) |
| Spatial Genetic Structure | Explore the spatial genetic structure of data downloaded from PhylogatR by: i) importing your genetic and geographic data, ii) visualizing sample density, and iii) exploring the genetic variation and how it is clustered. | [Spatial Genetic Structure](assets/modules/Spatial_Genetic_Structure.html) |
| Genetic Diversity | Evaluate the genetic diversity of data downloaded from PhylogatR by: i) looping through all sequence alignments in your PhylogatR download to calculate genetic diversity and sampling range size, and ii) running a regression analysis to ask the question: does the size of the geographic range of sampling predict levels of genetic diversity? | [Genetic Diversity](assets/modules/phylogatR_genetic-diversity-4.html) |

## How PhylogatR Works

Patterns of genetic diversity within species contain information about the history of the species, including how it responded to historical climate change and the degree of isolation of its populations. For this reason, thousands of scientific projects have been funded by federal agencies with the goal of investigating the genetic diversity within a particular focal species. The data from these efforts, including the genetic data collected from a given specimen and the physical location from which that specimen was collected, are a valuable resource and typically are made available to other researchers upon publication of the study. However, since different types of data are stored in different databases, it can be difficult to access and assemble these data for reanalysis. PhylogatR is a database and web application that (i) aggregates genetic sequence data from GenBank and geographic occurrence data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), (ii) connects these data at the specimen level, and (iii) provides customized web-based apps that enable these data to be analyzed in a variety of ways.
