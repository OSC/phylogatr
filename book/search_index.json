[["index.html", " 1 Background 1.1 Prerequisites", " list of people updated 2021-01-27 1 Background Genetic data are almost like a time machine. Just as paleontologists can use the fossilized remains of dead plants and animals to learn about species that once lived on our planet, geneticists can use genetic data to learn about the history of species that are currently living on our planet. At a basic level, this works for the same reason that people tend to resemble their biological siblings. If you have a brother or a sister, both of you have inherited half of your DNA from each of your parents. The vast majority of this DNA, which is both a large molecule with billions of nucleotide bases and something like software code for a biological computer, is extremely stable. Very rarely, mistakes can occur during the process of meiosis and these mistakes are occasionally passed on to offspring, so the good news here is that you're not exactly like your parents! The better news from the standpoint of genetics is that these mistakes, which are referred to as mutations, provide a record of descent from common ancestors. As biologists, we can read this record in a manner that is similar to how a paleontologist would make inferences about how an extinct species may have lived. By the end of this book, you will be able to read this record for yourself using data collected from millions of samples and thousands of species. In the process of doing this, you'll learn about genetics, computer code, and biodiversity. The goals of our PhylogatR project are simple: we want to empower students to actively learn about genetics, computer code, and biodiversity by repurposing genetic and climatic data that cost millions of dollars and decades of hard work by thousands of scientists to acquire. We hope to highlight basic scientific research in a discipline that is fundamentally about global change. In the process of reading this book, working through the exercises, and designing your own research studies, you'll learn important skills and techniques in the data sciences that are applicable to any of a number of professions. We hope to convince you that the conservation of biodiversity is one of the most pressing issues facing people today, that this issue is exacerbated by climate change, and that we must value this irreplaceable natural resource before it goes extinct. Let's get started. 1.1 Prerequisites 1.1.1 R and RStudio R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. RStudio is a set of integrated tools designed to help you be more productive with R. You will need to install R and RStudio on your computer. See here for instructions. 1.1.2 R packages You will need to load R packages in order to obtain the functions necessary for the analyses that will be conducted throughout this book. If you have not already installed tehh called-for packages, you will need to do that first. See here for more information on package installation in R. In short, you will install R packages using the install.packages() function. You only need to install packages once on your computer, but you need to load the library every time you open a new R session.

Data in the biological sciences can consist of observations from natural systems, manipulative experiments, and quantitative measurements of any sort. Biologists collect data in any of a number of ways, from observing natural systems and making a record of their observations (e.g., bird watching surveys) to measuring the concentration of hormones in cellular tissue to sequencing DNA from samples and comparing it to sequences collected from other samples. While biology as a science has been around for centuries, many of the data we collect in this century are facilitated by technological advances. For example, while early researchers such as Darwin and Mendel inferred that there must be some physical mechanism for encoding hereditary information, it wasn't until 1944 that Avery first proposed that deoxyribonucleic acid could carry this hereditary information. By 1952, technological advances allowed Franklin to use X-rays to photograph the molecule, and then Watson and Crick used this vital information to determine that the shape of the DNA molecule was a double helix. With this critical piece of information in place, scientists worked tirelessly to develop technology that could be used to understand this molecule. Nirenberg discovered that nucleotide bases combined in groups of three to code for amino acids in 1965; Sanger developed technology for efficient sequencing of nucleotide bases in 1977; and by 1984 Mullis developed technology for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) which enabled scientists to magnify DNA in order to greatly increase the efficiency of sequencing reactions. Much of the data included in the PhylogatR database was collected using Sanger sequencing techniques and PCR. In 1990, the United States government allocated $3 billion towards the Human Genome Project which aimed to produce the first complete sequenced of all the DNA in human chromosomes. This project took 13 years to complete using largely Sanger sequencing methods. Similarly, most of the data available via PhylogatR were funded by government investment in basic research. Government agencies such as the National Science Foundation ($8.1 billion annual budget) and the National Institutes of Health ($39 billion annual budget) in the United States funded millions of dollars in grant proposals in 2019, money that ultimately comes from taxpayers (by comparison, the U. S. spent about $670 billion on defense spending in 2019). Most of this research money pays salaries for the scientists that do basic research, but some of it is used to pay for sequencing DNA and other data collection. Luckily, the investment in the Human Genome Project led to dramatic improvements in the technology used for sequencing DNA, and ultimately lowered the costs associated with genome sequencing. Today, genomes from individual people can be sequenced for less than $1000, and these sequences are used to design individualized medical treatments for patients with cancer and other diseases. The biological sciences went from having very little genetic data to being positively flooded with data, and this has created a huge demand for skilled professionals to conduct bioinformatic analyses. These researchers are knowledgeable about biology and genetics, skilled in computational data analysis, and have the ability to solve problems in creative ways. Like many jobs that require science and technology skills, bioinformaticians command high salaries. The bioinformatics skills that you learn by working on exercises using PhylogatR are directly transferrable to this profession. 2.2 Why species? Throughout this book, we'll focus our attention at the level of biological species. Species are one of the fundamental levels of biological organization and serve as a convenient transition between biological processes that operate within individuals (think metabolism, physiology, etc.) and the ecological ones that operate among individuals (think competition for resources, predation, etc.). Species are one of the ways that biological data are classified, in some sense they are analogous to different genres in literature. Just as all horror or mystery novels share certain attributes, the members of a species share certain biological characteristics. Notably, just as some horror novels are better than others, all individuals within a species are not identical, some are better at exploiting resources and thus are more likely to survive, reproduce, and leave offspring that do the same. These differences across individuals are essential to natural selection, the primary force that drives evolutionary change. Since the category of species is so essential to the biological sciences, an entire discipline known as taxonomy has developed to discover and describe species. Taxonomists use a system referred to as the binomial naming system to name species. Developed by Linneaus, this system uses the genus and species taxonomic ranks to describe species, and by convention is written with the former rank capitalized and in italics (e.g., Homo sapiens, Canis lupus). 2.3 The Scientific Method Before jumping into exercises that will teach you how to use PhylogatR, it would be useful to discuss the scientific method. While descriptions of this method vary, most science classes discuss a process where observations and information are used to form a hypothesis that makes predictions which are then tested by designing experiments that are cleverly designed to determine whether the predictions are supported or rejected. This approach to science is remarkably effective, and indirectly responsible for many of the technological advances that we take for granted every day. However, in order to apply this method to a historical science, we need to expand our view of the scientific method. Scientific disciplines such as paleontology, geology, and evolutionary biology are primarily concerned with understanding how historical processes have influenced the Earth in the present. The evidence used by these disciplines are often the results of the processes that we hope to learn about, for example the stratification in rock walls that we can observe in river canyons or the fossils of marine organisms that we can find in fossil beds far away from the ocean. Since testing hypotheses about the past cannot rely on experiments, scientists collect these data and then use them to build and test conceptual models. In order to facilitate this process, scientists also assume that the environmental forces which we can observe in the present have also been acting in the past. This viewpoint, known as uniformitarianism, enables scientists to gather evidence that pertains to historical processes and the apply this evidence to the predictions of the conceptual models that underly research in the various disciplines. Throughout this book, we'll develop some of these models, help you collect data using PhylogatR, and then demonstrate how such data can be used to test the predictions of these model. This process is analogous to designing an experiment and as such offers a powerful approach to learning about the past.

This mostly includes information about what species are found where, but can also include additional information from an individual at a particular location, such as DNA sequence data, sex, body size, or even body condition. These databases are populated by researchers who deposit their data after completion of a research project. For example, I1 have spent many hours in the field searching for several species of Plethodon salamander in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. For every individual I find I record GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude), along with other information about the location and individual. I also collect a non-invasive tissue sample to sequence DNA for those individuals in order to gain an understanding of the genetic variation within each species. Once I am finished with a research project, I can make these data publicly available by uploading the data to one of many repositories. We will focus on two main data repositories for this book that are used to feed our webserver that creates data-analysis-ready files. 4.1 Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) The Global Biodiversity Information Facility GBIF was established in 2001 with the goal to make biodiversity data from specimen collections and observations accessible to anyone anywhere and promote scientific collaboration . It is an international network where members participate in housing computer nodes and making decisions as a collective. As of August 2020, GBIF houses over one billion occurrence records for over one million species, from over 50,000 datasets. While there are geographic biases in the data and not all described species are included (Yesson et al. 2007; OTHER), this is a massive amount of data! These data have been used to study behavior, systematics, impacts of climate change, invasive species, conservation, and food security issues see GBIF's science review for more details. In the example in the opening paragraph, I could supply GBIF with information for each individual salamander that for which I was able to collect data. GBIF uses Darwin Core data standards (Wieczorek et al. 2012) and will not accept data that do not comply with these standards. Information from several aspects are required in data submissions, for example, record (e.g., nature of record, observer), event (e.g., date), location (e.g., GPS coordinates, locality descriptions), occurrence (e.g., associated sequence or media data), and taxon (e.g., scientific and common names; see Box 2. Taxonomy). Each term has a specific definition in order to standardize the data that is included. Because I also generated DNA sequence data associated with the individuals, I can include an identifier for that sequence for that individual that was deposited on a database that houses genetic data. Some problems that may be encountered when using this database are localities that are in a nearby waterbody for organisms that are known to be terrestrial, input errors where the sign is reversed for latitude or longitude, or latitude and longitude input as zero rather than identified as missing data. These can be rectified with some data cleaning steps we will discuss later in this chapter. 4.2 GenBank The occurrence data provided by GBIF are used for many purposes in the biodiversity sciences however, associated sequence data from open-source repositories can allow us to ask even more exciting questions in biology! GenBank is a collection of DNA sequence data from three organizations: DNA DataBank of Japan (DDBJ), the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), and GenBank at NCBI (Benson et al. 2013). The goals of GenBank, released in 1982, are to provide access to and encourage use within the scientific community of the most up-to-date DNA sequence information. There are several ways to obtain these data and several types of DNA data that are stored. We will focus on the Nucleotide database. Once data are submitted and approved, all DNA sequences are assigned a unique identifier called an accession number. GenBank currently houses 218,642,238 sequences and 654,057,069,549 base pairs. Again, this is a massive amount of data! In the example in the opening paragraph, I would supply GenBank with each DNA sequence for each individual. These data may then be downloaded by other users in conjunction with DNA sequences from other studies and other species to answer all kinds of questions in ecology, evolution, and conservation, many of which we will explore throughout this book. Some problems that may be encountered when using this database are misidentified species, changes in taxonomy after submission, poorly annotated sequences, and even some sequences that are parasites but are labeled as that species. These issues result in the inability to adequately align DNA sequences for downstream use. There are several steps that can be taken to minimize the amount of messy data, and these will be discussed later in this chapter. 4.3 PhylogatR Phylogatr (phylogeographic data aggregation and repurposing) links occurrence data from GBIF and sequence data from GenBank so that DNA sequences can be traced to a specific geographic location and analysed in bulk. The data downloads from phylogatr are DNA sequence alignments (as discussed in Chapter 2) with associated GPS coordinates that are analysis ready. Computer scripts are provided throughout this book to assist data analysis and provide user-friendly teaching tools. Analysis of these data can be conducted on the Ohio Supercomputer using R scripts or R Shiny apps provided by the phylogatr team. Phylogatr first pulls down data from GBIF that includes a GenBank accession number and those that include GPS coordinates. Several other filters available from GBIF are implemented, for example, fossil specimens are not included. These sequences are then retrieved by phylgatr and sorted by species and locus. There has been some debate as to whether open-source data that is readily available are valuable due to the unreliability in the data (Causey et al. 2004; Wheeler et al. 2004). We argue that data processing and checking has greatly improved (Guralnick and Hill 2009) and by carefully choosing data cleaning steps and practicing reproducibility standards, these data are invaluable in understanding patterns in biodiversity. In order to overcome the problems that might be encountered in the databases discussed above the following data cleaning steps are carried out. Duplicate entries are removed based on a sorting scheme that finds duplicate entries based on the same GenBank number, GBIF identifier, geographic coordinates, species name, and date of occurrence event. Gene names are then standardized to the best of our ability. Mitochondrial gene names were relatively easy to standardize because they are highly represented in GenBank and have an easily manageable number of genes. For example, the cytochrome oxidase b gene might be deposited on GenBank using any of the following abbreviations: Cytb, Cyt-b, COB. These types of issues are problematic for data science projects where we need to group things that are the same and separate things that are different. In this case we can standardize all cytochrome oxidase b sequences by calling them one name: cytb. This is a work in progress and as we learn more about genomics across the diversity of life, we will be able to standardize nuclear gene names more throroughly. Currently, in some instances you might have different gene abbreviations for the same gene across different organisms. The last step that phylogtr takes is to align sequences that are from the same locus for the same species. We use the program MAFFT v7 to align DNA sequences. During this process sequences are checked that they are going in the same direction. After this step, we need to check the alignments to make sure there are no really short or spurious sequences in the alignment. A bad alignment will vastly overestimate genetic distance among individuals in the alignment (see the last section of this chapter for an example of a bad alignment). We used TrimAI v1.2 to clean up the alignments automatically because there are too many to do this by eye. This step removes sequences that are really short (meaning there is a lot of missing data) so that any downstream analyses are not biased. Then it removes any sequences that do not overlap with the majority of sequences. This allows us to remove DNA sequences that have been labeled incorrectly. For more details on the phylogatr pipeline see PUBLICATION and GitHub page. Phylogatr numbers here: # sequences, genes, species etc. PIE CHARTS! 4.4 Using PylogatR The first step in using phylogatr is to decide what geographic region you are interested in exploring. This can be done by specifying longitude and latitude or drawing a box around the region of interest. Coming soon: clicking on continents or biogeographic regions? Skip this step if you want to download a global dataset. Then identify what taxonomic2 group you will focus on. In this example, I typed 'caudata' (a group of amphibians: salamanders) in the filter box, but you can also click on any names to keep those in your search. If you choose to type in a filter check, you'll want to check the search list because it will retain anything that has 'caudata' in the name. For example, see row two below (species: Monodelphis brevicaudata). It is an opossum, but the species name has 'caudata' nested within it. I only want salamanders, so I will click on 'Caudata' under family so everything else is removed. Skip this step if you want all species available. The data can be downloaded as a zip file or a tarball, depending on your operating system. The download includes a series of folders that are structured by taxonomy. The root folder will contain two files. Tab delimited file called genes.txt. This file contains the gene and species for every alignment in the download, the directory in which the data are found, proportion of sequences retained after cleaning steps, number of unaligned sequences, number of aligned sequences, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species, Subspecies (when applicable), and a column to indicate whether the GBIF and Genbank species names do no match. Your download will be a zip file called phylogatr-results. If you are using a Mac, the zip file will unzip when you double click on it. If you are using Windows, you must extract the files first (this is very important, otherwise the computer won't recognize the file). The cite.txt file contains the version numbers used for GBIF, GenBank, and phylogatr. The highest level of taxonomy that will have its own folder is Class. Then a series of folders will be nested within each of these folders, until you get to species. Each species folder will contain the following files: Fasta file with all the unaligned sequences for each locus with the file extension .fa Fasta file with the aligned sequences for each locus with the file extension .afa Tab-delimited file with data for each individual in the sequence alignment called occurrence.txt. This file contains the GenBank accession, GBIF ID, latitude, longitude, basis of record, geodetic datum, coordinate uncertainty, and issues. 4.5 Practice 4.5.1 Data checking and cleaning 4.5.1.1 Purpose This module is designed to explore data downloads from PhylogatR for observations that look spurious. Data cleaning, and filtering out bad data, is the most important step in a data science project. Bad data = bad results. The code presented here pulls genetic and geographic data downloaded from the PhylogatR website and allows you to visualize: i) aligned DNA sequences for all loci present for a species in the database and ii) geographic coordinates for all individuals within that particular species. This module will take you through the process of importing your data from PhylogatR, visualizing sequence alignments for individual loci simultaneously so that you may check them by eye, and plotting geographic coordinates of occurrences on a map for visual inspection. 4.5.1.1.1 Learning objectives Navigate an open-source database Explain why data cleaning is a necessary step in data analysis. Identify poorly aligned sequence data. Identify geographic outliers. 4.5.1.1.2 Packages needed for this module ape phangorn apex ggplot2 maps Load all the necessary packages necessary for this exercise. #load necessary packages library(ape) library(phangorn) library(apex) library(ggplot2) library(maps) 4.5.1.2 Importing Data Choose a species to assess sequence alignments and geographic coordinates. Navigate to the PhylogatR website to download data for your chosen species. Q1. For what species did you download data? Q2. How many loci are present in the download? We will import all the sequence alignments for one species. As a demonstratoin, my phylogatr-results folder is locoated on my Desktop and we are going to look at the data from the species Sorex palustris. When you import your own data from PhylogatR, you will need to change the path to the folder accordingly. Read more about file paths here. First, we need to store the path names of all of the aligned fasta files for our chosen species. Make sure your path is set to the folder of the species that you want to inspect. We will generate a list of paths to all of the aligned fasta files (i.e., all files in the species folder that end in .afa) using the function list.files and store this list in R as myfiles. #get paths to aligned fasta files in species folder (all .afa files in downloaded PhylogatR folder) myfiles&lt;-list.files(path=&quot;/Users/tpelletier/Desktop/phylogatr-results/Mammalia/Soricomorpha/Soricidae/Sorex-palustris&quot;, pattern=&quot;.afa&quot;, full.names=TRUE) Next, we will use the paths stored in myfiles to import our aligned fasta files and create a multidna object. A multidna object is a class of object used to store multiple DNA sequence alignments. Sequences are stored as a list, with each element of the list being a separate DNA alignment stored as a DNAbin matrix. For more information on DNAbin and multidna objects, see here. We will use the function read.multiFASTA to create a multidna object containing our aligned fasta files. In the likely case that some individuals are not sequenced for all loci, setting the argument add.gaps to FALSE will ensure that indivuals that do not have a sequence for a locus (gap only sequences) will not be added to the alignment. #create S4 class multidna object (contains DNAbin objects for all loci/.afa alignment files) multidna&lt;-read.multiFASTA(files=myfiles, add.gaps=FALSE) Q3. What are gaps in a DNA sequence alignment? Q4. Explain what is meant by a gap only sequence? 4.5.1.3 Visualizing sequence alignments Now we will use the plot function to visualize the separate alignments (i.e., loci) in our multidna object simultaneously. When set to FALSE, the argument rows will return each locus in a separate image. If set to true, all loci will be shown in a single image (note: depending on how many alignments you have, setting rows=TRUE may make your alignments too small to inspect). The resulting alignments will consist of a series of rows (each representing the DNA sequence of one individual) and columns (each representing a particular nucleotide position in the locus). Accession numbers for each individual are located to the left of each row and the species and gene/locus name are located at the bottom of the alignment. Nucleotides are color coded according to the legend located at the top of the alignment. These plots are for the Sorex palustris data. Your plots should look something like this. #visualize the seperate alignments in your multidna object simultaneously plot(multidna, rows=FALSE, ask=FALSE) Use the following code to export your alignments as a pdf. They will be exported as sequences.pdf into your current working directory, unless you change the file path. #export sequence alignments pdf(file=&quot;sequences.pdf&quot;) plot(multidna, rows=FALSE, ask=FALSE) dev.off() 4.5.1.3 Sequence alignments: what to watch out for The following alignments are meant to show you potential errors you might run into when inspecting your sequence alignments. PhylogatR takes steps to minimize these issues (see here), but it never hurts to check your data. In the first example, I have edited the alignment to contain sequences that have been entered in reverse (rev1-4) and reverse complement (revcompl1-2). As you can see, these sequences are comparable in length to the rest of the alignment and are lacking large regions of gaps. However, upon visual inspection they clearly do not line up with the rest of the alignment. These sequences can be checked and edited manually in a sequence viewing program (e.g., UGENE or mesquite). Q5. Describe in words what it means to reverse a sequence? Q6. Describe in words what it means to reverse compliment a sequence? In this next example, I have added parasitic sequences (parasite1-3) to the alignment. These sequences contain long regions of gaps and the regions of nucleotides present do not line up with the rest of the alignment. If your alignment has questionable sequences such as these, you can do a search of their accession numbers here to ensure they are from the correct species and locus. Q7. Do any of your alignments look suspect? How do you know? Q8. Submit the sequences.pdf file as part of your assignment. 4.5.1.4 Visualizing geographic coordinates Now we will use the occurrences.txt file located in the species folder of our PhylogatR download to plot geographic coordinates for all individuals within our species folder and check for potential errors. First, we will import our occurrences.txt file into R and save it as a data frame called occurrences. Again, my phylogatr-results folder is on my Desktop and we are going to look at the data from the occurrences.txt file located within the species Sorex palustris. When you import your own data from PhylogatR, you will need to change this path accordingly. Once that data has been imported into R, we will extract just the columns containing latitude and longitude (i.e., columns 3 and 4) and save them in R as geo. This isn't always necessary, but sometimes it can help to prune your data into smaller subsets that are you going to work with. #read in geographic coordinates occurrences&lt;-read.table(&quot;/Users/tpelletier/Desktop/phylogatr-results/Mammalia/Soricomorpha/Soricidae/Sorex-palustris/occurrences.txt&quot;, header=TRUE, sep=&quot;\\t&quot;) #extract latitude and longitude geo&lt;-occurrences[,c(3:4)] Now we will plot our geographic coordinates on a map to inspect for errors. In the resulting map, each red dot represents a single sampling locality. Please keep in mind that when using geographic coordinates in R, longitude (the x-axis) comes first, and latitude (the y-axis) comes second. #get world map world&lt;-map_data(&quot;world&quot;) #add coordinates to world map in an object called g g &lt;- ggplot() + geom_polygon(data = world, aes(x=long, y = lat, group = group), fill = &quot;lightgrey&quot;, color = &quot;gray30&quot;, size = .25) + coord_fixed(1.3) + xlab(&quot;Longitude&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Latitude&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Collection Locality Geographic Coordinates&quot;) + geom_point(data = geo, aes(x = longitude, y = latitude), color = &quot;red&quot;, size = 0.8) #plot g g The following code will export the map into your current working directory as map.pdf, unless you change the file path. #export map pdf(file=&quot;map.pdf&quot;) plot(g) dev.off() 4.5.1.4 Geographic coordinates: what to watch out for The following map is meant to show you potential errors you might encounter when inspecting your geographic data. You'll want to look out for any data points that are obviously outside of your species expected range. Data points that are very far away from the rest of the points (i.e., outliers) as well as data points in areas physiologically unlikely for your species (e.g., a terrestrial shrew in the middle of the ocean) should warrant further inspection. If you are unsure of the extent of your species range, you can search for your species here. Q9. Do any of your geographic coordinates look suspect? How do you know? Q10. Submit the map.pdf as part of your assignment. 4.5.2 Outliers Researcher profile Dr. Tara A Pelletier is an Assistant Professor of Biology at Radford University in Virginia. She began her life as a biologist while pursuing her BS in Biology at Salem State College in Massachusetts, where she learned to love herps and fieldwork. After working in industry for several years, she moved on to Portland State University in Oregon, studying phylogeography of the western red-backed salamander (Plethodon vehiculum) for her MS. It was there that she fell in love with genetics and realized the importance of statistics in biological research. She then earned her PhD from the Ohio State University in which she continued work on western Plethodon salamanders as a model system in phylogeography and developed her coding skills. Her passion now lies in teaching undergraduate biology using hands-on computational and field approaches that get students' hands dirty (both figuratively and literally) right from the start. Her current research focuses on understanding biodiversity patterns using data science and metabarcoding methods. People in general and biologists in particular, find it useful to group things. You wouldn't grab a book to read without knowing what genre it fell into right? Well, we can't study species effectively if we don't know what group they belong to either. Species are grouped into a hierarchical structure. The study of this hierarchical structure is called taxonomy. Organisms that are more closely related to one another, share more similar characteristics, and are therefore grouped together. The highest level of classification is Domain and contains three groups which are grouped together based on certain biochemical markers: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. Within the Eukarya are several Kingdoms including Animals, Plants, Fungi, and other single-celled Eukaryotes. All of these groups are split into smaller and smaller groups that are more specific the lower we go. In other words, the groups have more things in common as we move down the hierarchy. Species is the most specific we can get (though some people might argue that subspecies are a thing). Species are groups of individuals that are more similar to each other than they are to other individuals. Species are named using both their genus and species. For example, the western red-backed salamander's scientific name is Plethodon vehiculum. This binomial naming convention has been used for centuries, starting with Carolus Linnaeus (1701-1778), a Swedish naturalist, and these names are used internationally by scientists. People devote their lives to this important work, with the aim to understand the relationships among all life on Earth in a field called systematics. You can visit the website for the Society for Systematic Biologists for more information on the work done by current systematists.

This genetic diveristy is resposible for the diversity we observe within species (e.g., thermal tolerance, body size). This diversity is essential if species are going to survive environmental change and we can sequence DNA from individuals within a species to obtain measures of genetic diversity.The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) included genetic diversity among its 2010 biodiversity targets. The IUCN red list is an international effort to list species as either least concern (LC), near threatened (NT), vulnerable (VU), endangered (EN), or critically endangered (CR) in order to adequately protect species that are in need. This exercise will use data from an open-source genetic database to answer the question: Is the IUCN red list designed to help protect species with low genetic diveristy that would put them at a higher risk of extinction? 12.2.0.1.1 Learning objectives: Explain why genetic diversity is an important concept in conservation biology. Provide examples as to why open-source databases are valuable tools in conservation biology. Conduct data analysis using the R statistical computing language. Interpret plots in order to answer a research question. 12.2.0.1.2 Packages needed for this module ggplot2 tools ade adegenet ape pegas stringr tidyr Load packages. library(ggplot2) library(tools) library(adegenet) library(pegas) library(stringr) library(tidyr) 12.2.0.2 Download genetic data Choose a taxonomic group to study for the above question.
