# Teacher Resources

We are currently developing educational modules for use in secondary and college level classes. Modules will support interactive analysis of *PhylogatR* data through R Shiny applications and include documentation for educators to facilitate classroom use and ensure specific learning objectives are met.

You can access working drafts of these modules below.

| Module  | Purpose  | Link  |
| :----  | :-----  | :------ |
| Checking Your Data  | Check genetic and geographic data downloaded from *PhylogatR* through visualization of: i) aligned DNA sequences for all loci present for a particular species in the database and ii) geographic coordinates for all individuals within that species. | [Checking Your Data](assets/modules/Checking_Your_Data.html) |
| Checking Your Data 2  | Check genetic data downloaded from *PhylogatR* by screening for outliers using measures of genetic diversity. | [Checking Your Data 2](assets/modules/Checking_Your_Data_2.html) |
| Spatial Genetic Structure | Explore the spatial genetic structure of data downloaded from *PhylogatR* by: i) importing your genetic and geographic data, ii) visualizing sample density, and iii) exploring the genetic variation and how it is clustered. | [Spatial Genetic Structure](assets/modules/Spatial_Genetic_Structure.html) |
| Genetic Diversity | Evaluate the genetic diversity of data downloaded from *PhylogatR* by: i) looping through all sequence alignments in your *PhylogatR* download to calculate genetic diversity and sampling range size, and ii) running a regression analysis to ask the question: does the size of the geographic range of sampling predict levels of genetic diversity? | [Genetic Diversity](assets/modules/phylogatR_genetic-diversity.html) |
